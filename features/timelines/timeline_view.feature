          | Standard Project      |

      And the following planning element types are default for projects of type "Standard Project"
          | Phase     |
          | Milestone |

      And there is 1 user with:
          | login | manager |

          | delete_planning_elements  |
          | edit_planning_elements   |
          | delete_planning_elements |

      And there is a project named "ecookbook" of type "Standard Project"
      And I am working in project "ecookbook"

      And the project uses the following modules:
          | timelines |

      And the user "manager" is a "manager"

      And I am logged in as "manager"

      And there are the following planning elements:
              | Subject  | Start date | Due date   | description       | status_name    | responsible    |
              | January  | 2012-01-01 | 2012-01-31 | Aioli Grande      | closed         | manager        |

  Scenario: The project manager gets 'No data to display' when there are no planning elements defined
     When I go to the   page of the project called "ecookbook"
      And I toggle the "Timelines" submenu
      And I follow "Timeline reports"
     Then I should see "New timeline report"
     And I should see "General Settings"

      And I follow "Timeline reports"
     Then I should see "New timeline report"
      And I should see "Testline"
      And I should be on the page of the timeline "Testline" of the project called "ecookbook"

   @javascript

    When there is a timeline "Testline" for project "ecookbook"
      And I go to the page of the timeline "Testline" of the project called "ecookbook"
      And I wait for timeline to load table
      And I click on the Planning Element with name "January"
     Then I should see a modal window
      And I should see "#1: January" in the modal
      And I should see "Aioli Grande" in the modal
      And I should see "01/01/2012" in the modal
      And I should see "01/31/2012" in the modal
      And I should see "New timeline report"
      And I should be on the page of the timeline "Testline" of the project called "ecookbook"
